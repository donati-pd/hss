#' hss: Hunter survey simulations, and estimations of harvest.
#'
#' There are three families of function within this package:
#' \code{\link{pop}},
#' \code{\link{est}},
#' and \code{\link{pae}}
#'
#' @section pop functions:
#' Simulate a population of hunters, simulate harvest, and
#' their response to different survey methods.
#'
#' @section est functions:
#' Make total harvest estimates from simulated data created by
#' pop functions.
#'
#' @section pae functions:
#' Simulate populations, and create estimates from them, all in one function.
#' Useful when many simulations need to be completed.
#' These functions allow for repeated simulation, and some of the simulation
#' parameters can be changed within each iteration.
